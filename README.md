# Churn Prediction with Tree-based Methods ðŸŒ³ðŸ“ˆ

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks developed as part of the Master of Data Science study at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). The project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry using tree-based methods. The process includes exploratory data analysis, feature selection, pre-processing, and the application of Decision Tree and Ensemble classification models.

## Notebooks ðŸ““

1. **Telco Churn Analysis - Part 1 (Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection and Pre-Processing).ipynb** ðŸ“Š
    - This notebook covers the initial steps of the project: Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, and Pre-Processing. These techniques are applied to a dataset from the telecommunications industry, preparing it for subsequent machine learning models.

2. **Telco Churn Analysis - Part 2 (Decision Tree Classification Model).ipynb** ðŸŒ³
    - In this part of the project, a Decision Tree model is applied to the pre-processed data with the aim of predicting customer churn. The performance of the model is evaluated and its results are interpreted.

3. **Telco Churn Analysis - Part 3 (Ensemble Classification Model).ipynb** ðŸš€
    - This notebook introduces Ensemble methods, powerful techniques that combine multiple models for improved performance. An Ensemble model is applied to the churn prediction task and its performance is compared with the Decision Tree model.

## Dataset ðŸ“Š

The dataset used in this project is `telco_data.csv`, which contains information about a telecom company's customers, including whether they churned or not. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

## Getting Started ðŸš€

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn_prediction_with_tree_based_methods.git
cd churn_prediction_with_tree_based_methods
pip install -r requirements.txt
